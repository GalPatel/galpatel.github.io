I'm a research intern at Ask-AI, working with <a href='https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~joberant/'>Prof. Jonathan Berant</a>.

I am a recent graduate of the M.Sc. program in Computer Science at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~oabend/">Prof. Omri Abend</a>. 

My research interests are anything to do with: interpretability of NLP models, cognitively-motivated approaches, model alignment and linguistic comprehension.

<i>I'd be happy to talk about any research opportunities, feel free to reach out!</i>
