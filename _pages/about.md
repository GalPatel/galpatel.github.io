I'm a research intern at Ask-AI, working with <a href='https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~joberant/'>Prof. Jonathan Berant</a>.

I am a recent graduate of the M.Sc. program in Computer Science at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~oabend/">Prof. Omri Abend</a>. Before that, I've completed a Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

I am interested in how language is processed in artificial intelligence systems as opposed to the human brain. I am is interested in the interpretability and alignment of NLP models, especially when using cognitively-motivated approaches. I aim to contribute to the development of safe, robust, and data-efficient systems.

<i>I'd be happy to talk about any research opportunities, feel free to reach out!</i>
