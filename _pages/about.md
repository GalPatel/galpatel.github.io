I'm a research intern at Ask-AI, working with <a href='https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~joberant/'>Prof. Jonathan Berant</a>.

I am a recent graduate of the M.Sc. program in Computer Science at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~oabend/">Prof. Omri Abend</a>. Before that, I've completed a Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

I am interested in how language is processed in artificial intelligence systems as opposed to the human brain. I'm interesten in interpretability and alignment of NLP models and model alignment, especially when using cognitively-motivated approaches to develop robust and data-efficient systems. I hope to contribute to AI-Safety in the future.

<i>I'd be happy to talk about any research opportunities, feel free to reach out!</i>
